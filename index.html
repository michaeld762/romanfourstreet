  <h1>Roman Four Street Poker (RFS) Rules</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Dealer deals each player cards clockwise:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>1–4 players: 6 cards each</li>
        <li>5–8 players: 4 cards each</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Players may only look at their own cards.</li>
      <li>Players may fold any of their cards, but only in pairs (two at a time).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Board</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The dealer lays out the board in the specified Roman Four Street layout (image reference).</li>
      <img src = "image_67513345JPG">
      <li>The board has four streets.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Blinds & Card Allocation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Small and big blinds are placed on the vertical (North/South) street.</li>
      <li>Each player allocates two cards to each street, attempting to form the best 5-card hand per street (as in standard No-Limit Hold'em).</li>
      <li>Allocations are done one street at a time.</li>
      <li>You can’t allocate cards to the same street more than once.</li>
      <li>Use card protectors or markers to indicate card allocations per street.</li>
      <li>Each allocation requires an ante equal to the small blind amount.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Middle Street Bidding</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Players bid to eliminate 2 cards from the 7-card middle (horizontal) street.</li>
      <li>Bidding occurs left to right (East to West) from the dealer’s perspective, then again right to left.</li>
      <li>Bids (chips) are placed directly on top of each card.</li>
      <li>The two cards with the highest bids are removed, and their bids go into the middle street pot.</li>
      <li>If there's a tie, tied cards are rebid on. If a tie persists, cards (excluding the face-down center card) are shuffled and randomly eliminated until only 5 remain.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Betting Rounds</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Betting starts with the vertical street after the top and bottom cards are flipped.</li>
      <li>Only players active on that street may bet, check, raise, or fold.</li>
      <li>Once the 3rd and 4th middle cards are revealed, players may bet on the middle and side (East/West) streets—one street at a time.</li>
      <li>Finally, flip the last middle card and allow additional betting on the vertical and middle streets.</li>
      <li>Players may fold a specific street while remaining active on others.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
